Annual Basic = Monthly salary x 12 months
Annual Base Salary = Annual Basic + Annual Wage Supplement (AWS is guaranteed fixed bonus which some organization may provide. It's optional depending on the company's policy). If there is no AWS, Annual Basic = Annual Base.
Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) is a common business practice in companies in Singapore, as well as other Asian countries. It is also known as the 13th month payment. It represents a single annual payment to employees that is supplementary to the total amount of annual wages earned.
The Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) is treated similarly to a bonus payment that depends on an employee’s basic pay. 
Annual Total Cash = Sum of Annual Base + all variable cash (variable bonus, sales commission, incentives, LTI, etc. Any payout that is linked with performance and not guaranteed).
Annual Total Earnings = Sum of Annual Total Cash + all fixed cash allowances (housing allowance, meal allowance, transport allowance, etc).
Annual Total Remuneration = Sum of Annual Total Earnings + all benefits in-kind (insurance cover, provision of car, housing, club membership, etc).
Annual Total Employment Cost = Sum of Total Remuneration + contribution to the Central Provident Fund (CPF).
